      <p>I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, but moved to Virginia at a very young age. I grew up in a small town in midwest Virginia with cows in my backyard and corn right next door.</p>
      <p>As I grew up, I learned the importance of patience and hard work through piano lessons, recreational basketball, and playing the piccolo in marching band. I have always been dedicated to learning and trying my hardest.</p>
      <p>I am now attending Virginia Tech and studying Political Science with a focus on legal studies and Technical and Professional Writing. I also serve on the leadership team of RUF, a campus ministry, and correspond with the Pregnancy Resource Center in order to organize events and outreach programs.</p>
      <p>I hope to expand my experience in both politics and technical writing and editing.
